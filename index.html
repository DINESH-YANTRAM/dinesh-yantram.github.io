          <p class="subtitle">
            From a single problem – missed early warning signs – to a full ecosystem for continuous, intelligent care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yantram Medtech Pvt Ltd is a health-tech startup building an integrated ecosystem of
            <strong>wearable medical devices</strong>, <strong>AI-driven patient management software</strong>,
            and <strong>mobile applications</strong> that connect patients, nurses, doctors and systems on one unified platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started with a simple but vital question: <em>“How many complications in newborns and adults could be
            prevented if we had continuous, structured data at the right time?”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team has taken multiple products from concept to clinical pilots and commercialization, secured competitive
            grants in India and the UK, and built an interoperable hospital platform designed for the realities of
            high-volume, resource-constrained settings.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            “We want early detection and intelligent triage to be the default, not the exception –
            from a village PHC to a tertiary hospital.”

            Yantram Medtech sits at the intersection of medical devices, AI-driven software and public health impact.
            We are building an integrated stack that can scale from a single clinic to entire districts and states –
            while generating structured, high-quality data that powers better decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our long-term ambition is to build a category-defining health-tech company with the governance, compliance
            and scalability required for eventual public markets, while staying deeply grounded in real-world clinical needs.
